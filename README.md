# Installation

  Clone the Repository:
          1) git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/tetris-shell-game.git
          2) cd tetris-shell-game

  Make the Game Executable:
          1) chmod +x tetris.sh

  Run the Game:
          1) ./tetris.sh

  *** Note: This game requires a Linux environment with bash installed.

# Usage
To start playing Tetris, simply run the tetris.sh file:
            ./tetris.sh

The game will open in the terminal, and you can control the blocks using keyboard inputs.

# Features
  Classic Gameplay: Experience the classic Tetris game in a minimalistic command-line interface.
  Customizable Settings: Modify the settings within the script, such as block shapes and game speed.
  Score Tracking: Tracks your score, rewarding you for completed lines.
  Keyboard Controls: Simple arrow keys for moving and rotating blocks.

# How to Play
  Move Left/Right: Use the left and right arrow keys.
  Rotate Block: Use the up arrow key.
  Drop Block Faster: Use the down arrow key.


The objective is to create complete horizontal lines, which will then be cleared from the screen, earning you points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.
